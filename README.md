# Sports Cards API
## Description 
Building a small API for users to perform CRUD operations for Sports cards.
## Why Was this built?
After looking around for a Sports card 3rd Party API, the only options i could find were ones that were subscription based or pay to use.
After seeing that i decided to create my own to incorporate into a different project. It is a baseline for any users who want to build a Sports Cards RESTUFL API.
## Features of the Sports Card API
Some of the options i built are to get cards based off of brand, player prefix, true or false that the card is a rookie, and also if the card is numbered or not.
Other options include a patch to edit the card based off of entering the ID of the card the user would like to edit. Another option is to post a card 
based off of the Model information for Cards. The user can also delete a card based off of the ID selected.
