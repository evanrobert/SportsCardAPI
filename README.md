# Sports Cards API

## Description
This project involves building a small API for users to perform CRUD operations on Sports cards.

## Motivation
When searching for a third-party API for Sports cards, the available options were either subscription-based or required payment. As a result, I decided to create my own API for use in another project. It serves as a foundation for users who wish to develop their own Sports Cards RESTful API.

## Features of the Sports Card API
The API offers various functionalities, including:
- Retrieving cards based on brand
- Searching for cards by player name prefix
- Filtering cards based on whether they are rookies (true/false)
- Identifying numbered cards
- Updating a card's information using the card's ID
- Adding new cards by submitting the Card model information
- Deleting a card based on its ID

This API provides a comprehensive set of operations for managing sports cards.

Your contributions and suggestions are welcome. Feel free to explore and enhance the API!

Please note: It's always a good idea to double-check the code, test thoroughly, and ensure the API's security before deployment.
